# Design Principles

Design principles, also known as software design principles, are guidelines and best practices that software developers follow to create high-quality software that is easy to maintain, scalable, and reusable. These principles are based on years of experience and have been developed to help software developers design and build software systems that are efficient, maintainable, and adaptable to changing requirements. There are several design principles, including SOLID principles, DRY principle, KISS principle, YAGNI principle, and others, which help developers create software that is easy to understand, test, and modify. By following these principles, software developers can create software that is efficient, maintainable, and adaptable to changing requirements, and can avoid common problems such as code duplication, poor maintainability, and scalability issues.

This repository contains explanations of the following design principles.
